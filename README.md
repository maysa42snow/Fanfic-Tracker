# 🌟 Fanfic Tracker

A cute little web app I made to track all the fanfics I wanna read (or reread 10 times).  
You can add fics by title, author, ship, word/chapter count, summary, and notes — then change the status as you read.  
When you're done reading, rate it with stars, leave a final comment, and even mark it as a favorite 💖

## ✨ Features

- Add fanfics with all the details you care about  
- Set the status to: **To Read**, **Reading**, or **Complete**
- When reading, you get a chapter progress bar so you can keep track
- When complete, you can:
  - Rate from 0 to 10 ⭐️
  - Leave a final comment
  - Mark it as a favorite ❤️
- Filter fics by **Ship**, **Size** (short/medium/long), and **Status**
- Edit or delete any fic anytime
- Click on fic title to open the link directly
- Dark Mode 🌙 toggle for the aesthetics

## 🌈 Categories

- **Ship**: Whatever pairing/threesome/freakshow you want
- **Size**:
  - Short: under 10k words
  - Medium: 10k–50k
  - Long: over 50k
- **Status**: Track where you’re at in your fanfic journey

## 🛠 How to Use

1. Clone or download the repo
2. Open `index.html` in your browser
3. Start adding fics!

All your data is saved locally (no servers), so no one’s judging your fic taste 😌

## 🖤 Why I Made This

I read a lot of fanfic. Like. A lot.  
And AO3 bookmarks just weren’t cutting it anymore.  
So I made this thing to organize my chaos and keep track of my hyperfixations.

## 💡 Ideas for Later

- Tags and fandom filters
- AO3 link auto-detection
- Backup/export to file
- Mobile UI improvements

**Made with love and way too many sleepless nights.** ☕  
Feel free to fork, remix, or just use it to stay organized 🫶
